# Degrees_of_Difficulty
Pretty simple stuff this week. I (manually...) grabbed the 7-day forecast from @NY1's twitter account and dumped it all into [NY1_weather.csv](https://github.com/PerplexCity/Degrees_of_Difficulty/blob/master/NY1_weather.csv), along with the actual forecasts from Weather Underground. 

R Studio turns that csv into some graphs via [weather.R](https://github.com/PerplexCity/Degrees_of_Difficulty/blob/master/weather.R).
